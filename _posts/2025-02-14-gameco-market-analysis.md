### The Problem & Objective
GameCo. executives were operating under a critical, untested assumption: that their global sales trends were stable, with North America consistently being their most profitable market. My objective was to use historical sales data to either validate this assumption or provide a new, evidence-based strategic direction. The central question was: **Where should GameCo. focus its marketing budget in 2017 for the highest return on investment?**

**My Role:** Data Analyst  
**Context:** Solo project simulating a real-world business intelligence task.  
**Duration:** 2 Weeks  
**Tools:** MS Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Advanced Charting), PowerPoint

### My Process: From Raw Data to Actionable Insight

My approach was to methodically clean the data, perform an exploratory analysis, and then visualize key trends to uncover the story hidden within the numbers.

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset was comprehensive but contained inconsistencies. My first step was to ensure data integrity by:
- Deleting duplicated records and rows with missing game names.
- Applying mean imputation to fill partially empty sales data, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
- Filtering out irrelevant data from early years (1980-1982) and future years (2017+) to focus on the most relevant time period.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With a clean dataset, I computed summary statistics and found that sales distributions were heavily right-skewed. This indicated that the market was hit-driven, with a small number of blockbuster games accounting for a majority of the revenue, highlighting a potential volatility risk.

#### 3. Uncovering the Core Insight: A Shifting Global Market
The central assumption of North American dominance was fundamentally disproved. My analysis revealed a dramatic and unexpected shift: while North America was once the dominant market, its share had been in a steady decline, while Europe's market share had consistently grown, surpassing North America as the top market in 2016.

#### 4. Drilling Deeper: Understanding Regional Preferences
Knowing *where* the market was shifting was only half the story. I analyzed genre and platform performance within each region, revealing stark differences:
- **Genre:** NA and EU markets heavily favored Shooter and Sports games, while the Japanese market showed a strong, unique preference for Role-Playing Games (RPGs).
- **Platform:** Xbox was a powerhouse in North America, while PC gaming had a significantly stronger foothold in Europe.

### Final Solution & Recommendations

My analysis concluded that GameCo.'s assumption of a stable market was incorrect, requiring a proactive shift in strategy. I delivered a clear set of actionable recommendations based directly on the data.

#### Key Recommendations:
1.  **Reallocate Marketing Budget:** Shift primary focus and resources from the declining North American market to the growing and now-leading European market.
2.  **Localize Content & Campaigns:** Stop using a one-size-fits-all approach. Market RPGs on Nintendo platforms in Japan, and strengthen the PC gaming presence in Europe to maximize engagement.
3.  **Diversify Beyond Blockbusters:** Given the volatility of the hit-driven NA market, invest in a more diverse portfolio of games to ensure more stable revenue streams.

### Challenges & Lessons Learned
The primary challenge was that the dataset did not include sales from the rapidly growing digital and mobile markets. I highlighted this as a critical data gap in my final report. This project reinforced the importance of challenging core business assumptions with data and understanding that market trends are dynamic, not static.
